# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there

# Goals with this website:

- Structure into reading 2 hours every day
- Make it cheap to track and write blogs
- Pursue different avenues

# Ideas

- Github Issues as blog posts. Allows for editing and comments.
- Articles read tracker
- Separate the frontend from the data. Data resides mostly in Github Issues and Github Projects
- Use https://www.joshwcomeau.com/ 's website as a way to display the blog posts and websites
- I am not sure which framework to use.
- There would be certain components which I will be sharing across the whole web design space.
- How about I go vanilla JS and CSS for the first iteration and then move to a framework?

### Helpful stuff

- JS Diagram Tool [mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/). Useful for representing design diagrams
- [prismjs](https://prismjs.com/) for code highlighting
