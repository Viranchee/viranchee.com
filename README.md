# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there

My name is Viranchee. I am a Grad Student at NC State University
My focus areas are: Compilers, Operating Systems, Microprocessor Architecture
Technologies I like to work with: LLVM MLIR Rust Swift

### Current Important Project I'm working on:

- Personal: Website
- Microarchitecture: Superscalar Pipeline Simulator
- Cloud Computing: Cloud Architecture Design Proposal for replicating https://www.pointfree.co
- Operating Systems: Read/Write Locks with Priority Inheritance

## Tools and Technologies I am confident at:

- Swift, C++, C, Objective C, Python, Bash
- High Quality Software Development
- Object Oriented, Compositional, Protocol Oriented Programming
- Functional Programming
- OS Development
- Compiler passes
- LLVM Development
- Microprocessor Architecture Development

## Things I plan to explore:

- MLIR
- Operating Systems Development
- AI/ML
- Performance Monitoring
- Kubernetes
- eBPF
- Istio, cilium, envoy, graphql

## What I want to do with this Website:

- Sell myself to potential employers
- Showcase my past work
- Set future goals and work on them
- Build web apps and put them here
- Take notes using my blog?
- Maybe use Cloudflare Images and Stream, and build my social networking site?

# New Goals:

Write blogs often. Make writing and editing new blogs cheap
Track the link read cheap

- Github Issues as blog posts. Allows for editing and comments.
- Use https://www.joshwcomeau.com/ 's website as a way to display the blog posts and websites
- Use a reading tracker where I track all the articles, papers and knowledgebase I collect daily, in a seamless way.
- A good about page

### Helpful stuff

- JS Diagram Tool [mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/). Useful for representing design diagrams
- [prismjs](https://prismjs.com/) for code highlighting
